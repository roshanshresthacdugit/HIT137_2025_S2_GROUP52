This repository contains three Python programs corresponding to the assignment questions:

Question 1 – Encryption & Decryption

    File: EncryptionDecryption.py
    Implements custom encryption and decryption rules for alphabetic characters.
    Reads from raw_text.txt, generates encrypted_text.txt and decrypted_text.txt.
    Includes a verification step to confirm correctness.

Question 2 – Temperature Analysis

    File: TemperatureAnalysis.py
    Loads multiple CSV files from the ./temperatures/ folder.
    Performs the following analyses:
    Seasonal average temperatures (average_temp.txt)
    Station with the largest temperature range (largest_temp_range_station.txt)
    Most stable and most variable stations (temperature_stability_stations.txt)

Question 3 – Recursive Fractal Drawing

    File: PatternDrawing.py
    Draws fractal polygons using Python’s turtle graphics.
    Accepts user input for:
    Number of sides (must be ≥ 3 for a valid polygon)
    Side length
    Recursion depth
    Demonstrates recursion and geometry through fractal patterns
